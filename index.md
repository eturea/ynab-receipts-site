### 2️⃣ AI Extracts the Details
Apple Intelligence analyzes the receipt on-device, extracting merchant name, date, total, and individual line items.

### 3️⃣ Review and Verify
Check the confidence score and extracted data. Edit any fields as needed. The app suggests YNAB categories automatically.

### 4️⃣ Sync to YNAB
Choose a YNAB account and sync. The transaction appears in your budget with all line items as subtransactions. Or save locally to sync later.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is YNAB Receipts?**
A: YNAB Receipts is an iOS app that uses Apple Intelligence to scan paper receipts and create transactions in your YNAB (You Need A Budget) account. It's built for YNAB users who want to digitize receipts and track purchases with line-item detail.

**Q: Do I need a YNAB account?**
A: Yes. YNAB Receipts requires an active YNAB subscription to sync receipts. You can scan and store receipts locally without YNAB, but syncing requires authentication.

**Q: Is YNAB Receipts affiliated with YNAB?**
A: No. YNAB Receipts is an independent app developed by eTurea. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by YNAB (Steine LLC).

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: YNAB Receipts is **completely free**. No in-app purchases, no subscriptions, no ads.

### Privacy & Data

**Q: Are my receipts uploaded to the cloud?**
A: **No.** All receipt processing happens entirely on your device using Apple Intelligence. We do not operate any servers that collect or store your data.

**Q: Does the app track my usage or show ads?**
A: **No.** We do not use analytics tools, advertising networks, or any form of user tracking. Your privacy is paramount.

**Q: What data is sent to YNAB?**
A: Only transaction details (merchant, date, amount, category, line items) and only when you explicitly choose to sync a receipt. We never send your entire receipt image to YNAB.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: Receipts are stored locally on your device using SwiftData (Apple's data persistence framework). OAuth tokens are stored in iOS Keychain. If you have iCloud Backup enabled, your receipt data may be included in encrypted backups.

**Q: Can I delete my data?**
A: Yes. You can delete individual receipts anytime, disconnect your YNAB account in Settings, or delete the app entirely to remove all local data.

### Features & Functionality

**Q: What information does the app extract from receipts?**
A: The app uses Apple Intelligence to extract:
- Merchant name
- Transaction date
- Total amount
- Individual line items (with quantities and prices)
- Suggested YNAB categories (matched from your budget)

**Q: How accurate is the AI extraction?**
A: Accuracy depends on receipt quality, formatting, and legibility. The app provides a confidence score to help you assess extraction quality. You should always review extracted data before syncing to YNAB.

**Q: Can I edit extracted information?**
A: Yes. You can edit any extracted field before syncing. After syncing, most fields can be updated except transaction dates and subtransactions (YNAB API limitation).

**Q: Does the app support line items?**
A: Yes! Extracted line items are synced to YNAB as subtransactions, giving you detailed purchase breakdowns in your budget.

**Q: Can I save receipts without syncing to YNAB?**
A: Yes. You can save receipts locally-only and sync them later, or keep them as local records indefinitely.

**Q: What happens if a receipt scan fails?**
A: The app validates photo quality before scanning and provides helpful feedback. If extraction fails or is inaccurate, you can manually edit the data or retake the photo.

### YNAB Integration

**Q: Does YNAB Receipts modify my existing transactions?**
A: No. The app only creates new transactions that you approve or updates transactions previously created by this app.

**Q: Can I choose which YNAB account to use?**
A: Yes. When syncing a receipt, you select which YNAB account (checking, credit card, etc.) to create the transaction in.

**Q: What YNAB data does the app access?**
A: The app accesses:
- Budget names and IDs
- Account names and IDs
- Category groups and categories
- Category availability (to prevent overspending)

The app does **not** access:
- Account balances or net worth
- Existing transactions from other sources
- Banking credentials
- Personal profile information

**Q: What are the YNAB API limitations?**
A: Due to YNAB API restrictions:
- **Transaction dates cannot be changed** after syncing (you must delete and re-scan)
- **Subtransactions cannot be edited** after syncing (delete and re-scan required)
- The app directs you to YNAB's web/mobile app for these edits

**Q: How do I disconnect from YNAB?**
A: Go to Settings → YNAB Connection → Disconnect. This immediately removes your OAuth tokens from iOS Keychain. Your locally saved receipts remain on your device.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What devices are supported?**
A: YNAB Receipts requires:
- iPhone or iPad with Apple Intelligence support
- A17 Pro chip or later (iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16 series, or M-series iPad)
- iOS 26.0 or later

The app will not appear in the App Store for incompatible devices.

**Q: Why does the app require Apple Intelligence?**
A: Apple Intelligence (Foundation Models framework) provides the on-device AI that extracts structured data from receipts. This ensures your receipt images never leave your device.

**Q: Can I use Siri to scan receipts?**
A: Yes! The app supports Siri voice commands and Shortcuts integration. You can say "Hey Siri, scan a receipt in YNAB Receipts" or create custom automation workflows.

**Q: Does the app work offline?**
A: Receipt scanning works completely offline (on-device AI). Syncing to YNAB requires an internet connection.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The app says "Apple Intelligence Required"—what does this mean?**
A: Your device doesn't support Apple Intelligence. You need an iPhone 15 Pro or later, or an iPad with an M-series chip running iOS 26+. Check Settings → Apple Intelligence & Siri to verify availability.

**Q: OAuth fails with "invalid_client"—how do I fix this?**
A: This usually means:
- Invalid YNAB client credentials (developer-side issue—contact support)
- Incorrect redirect URI configuration
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting your YNAB account

**Q: Receipt scanning quality is poor—what can I do?**
A: Ensure:
- Good lighting (natural light works best)
- Clean camera lens (app validates this)
- Receipt is flat and fully visible
- High-contrast background (dark receipts on light background or vice versa)
- Check the photo quality validation feedback

**Q: Categories aren't being suggested—why?**
A: Make sure:
- You're connected to YNAB and have selected a budget
- Your budget has active categories
- You have an internet connection (categories are fetched from YNAB)
- Category caching is working (check Settings)
